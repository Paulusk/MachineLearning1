This code defines a model that takes as input an array of numbers and predicts whether the sum of those numbers is greater than or 
equal to 1. The model is trained using data generated by the function generateData, which returns an example and a label. 
This model has two hidden layers with 4 units each, and uses the 'relu' activation function. The output layer has 1 unit and
uses the 'sigmoid' activation function, which squashes the output to be between 0 and 1. The model is trained using the 'binaryCrossentropy'
loss function and the 'adam' optimizer. The model is trained on 2000 examples and evaluated on 100 examples at the end of each epoch. 
The training progress is logged to the console at the end of each epoch.
